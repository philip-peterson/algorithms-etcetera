What is this?
=============

It's a collection of explanations about the usefulness, applicability, etc. of various data structures and algorithms I encounter. Mostly a sandbox for me to practice implementing them, so as to understand them myself.


Note about lack of Pythonicity
==============================
This code is written in Python, but it is intentionally written in a way such that it can be easily rewritten in other languages. Therefore, constructs such as list comprehensions, lambdas, and so on are avoided because they are harder to directly translate.

One should therefore try not to view these programs as *Python* implementations of the data structures and algorithms but rather simply implementations. Python is merely used in this project for readability, not for elegance.
